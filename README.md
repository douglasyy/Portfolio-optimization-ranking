# Portfolio-optimization-ranking
The current progree I made in profolio weights optimization &amp; ranking: 1. Web Scraping historical 110 stocks prices from Yahoo Finance, together with other financial related data (planning to add it as the features to our model) 2. An optimization model based on factor analysis (using prices and related data) 
The current progree I made in profolio weights optimization & ranking:
1. Web Scraping historical 110 stocks prices from Yahoo Finance, together with other financial related data (planning to add it as the features to our model)
2. An optimization model based on factor analysis (using prices and related data)
3. A ranking system to assign the probability of each stock falling into different scales (1 indeicates best, 5 worst)
4. To learn the most fundamental ideas regarding this project, go to the factor_analysis_performance_prediction. That is the underlying model drives the whole project!!!
